## Game Rules

- Types of Planets

1 Genesis Planet: The starting point of the game, where all voting and decisions begin.
2 Journey Planet: Various decision points during the game, players vote to decide the next move.
3 Smart Planet: The planet that finally defeats Al, and occupying it will earn Smart Star points.

- Reward Distribution Mechanism
  
1 For each Wisdom Planet occupied, the points earned by players are distributed according to certain rules. Each level of Journey Planet keeps half of the points for itself and returns half to the previous level. This way, even players who contributed early on can benefit, and they can also receive earnings from multiple branches.

2 If a Journey Planet receives only one vote, we continue in that direction, exploring the next planet.

3 If a Journey Planet receives two or more votes, this path opens up new possibilities. Now, players can cast more votes on this new planet, deciding how to further explore.


## Experimental
UniLand is not just an Othello game, but an experimental extension of ZK privacy blockchain technology. We aim to transfer more collective intelligence of players to AI, and this process hopes to realize voting management and reward distribution through ZKâ€™s privacy technology. This makes the game interaction more fair and interesting, and traces the intellectual contributions of humans.
